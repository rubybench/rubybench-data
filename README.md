# Rubybench data

This repository contains I/O data for the
[rubybench](https://github.com/rubybench/rubybench) benchmark runner.

- `rubies.yml` is updated via Github Actions and lists each commit from Ruby
  master tested on each day.

- The rest of this repository consists of benchmark results from the suites
  tested by rubybench. They are incrementally updated and displayed on
  [rubybench.github.io](https://rubybench.github.io)
